# flashier_sort
Flashier Sort is a sorting algorithm similar to Flash Sort.
However, it does not have an extra paramter, or no bins. Instead it operates on new arrays, calculating "collisions" and "offsets".

**TODO**: The base `flash_sort` under `flash.h` does not work. Need to implement a correct flash sort.
