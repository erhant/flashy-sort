# flashier_sort
Flashier Sort is a sorting algorithm similar to Flash Sort.
However, it does not have an extra paramter, or no bins. Instead it operates on new arrays, calculating "collisions" and "offsets".

**TODO**: 
- The base `flash_sort` under `flash.h` does not work. Need to implement a correct flash sort.
- Can get rid of `newArray` with negative painting on positive arrays.
- Need to fix the insertion sort probably.
- Write python code for this too, to better understand what happens to the arrays
