Flash Sort:
  - Results are wrong
  For low N values, the results seem to be wrong, need to find out why.

Flashy Sort:
  - There is an implementation `flashy_sort_2` with in-place placements. Can we modify that to use just one array `collisions` and get rid of `placements` array?
  + If not, the `flash_sort` implementation is good, it uses an additional array to write on to, and then uses `memcpy` to write back. This may also be faster than the in-place method.

Evaluations:
  - Compare the performance of **Flashy Sort** to several others:
    - Radix Sort
    - Insertion Sort
    - Quick Sort
    - Merge Sort  
  - Write a sorter for various problem sizes.

Paper:
  - If the performance is good, can we make a paper about this? :)
